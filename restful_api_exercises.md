# RESTful API Practice

Create a README (`.md`) file and paste all of the responses from the server for each request. Utilize the [JSON Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) for each request.

1.  Send a `GET` request to the route `/users` to get the user with the `id` 7.
2.  Send a `PUT` request to the route `/posts` to change the title of the post with the `id` 57 to `"We The Best"`.
3.  Send a `DELETE` request to the route `/todos` to delete the Todo with the `id` 146.
4.  Send a `POST` request to the route `/albums` to create an album with the `userId` 10 and the `title` "My Summer Vacation".
5.  Send a `DELETE` request to the route `/users` to delete the user with the `id` 4.
6.  Send a `PUT` request to the route `/todos` to change the `userId` of the Todo to 6 where the `id` of the Todo is 51.
7.  Send a `POST` request to the route `/pictures` to add a picture of your choice with the `albumId` of 1.
8.  Send a `GET` request to the route `/albums` to get the album with the `id` of 3.
9.  Send a `DELETE` request to the route `/posts` to delete the post with the `id` of 73.
